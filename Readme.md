# Media "Manager"

This project is a proof of concept. It is designed to be able to generate content and automatically post it. This is meant for educational purposes only because I am like 99% sure that this violates every single terms of service agreements for every form of social media. The capabilities outlined here only describes the first version. I do intend on making more versions that are more advanced.

##

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all of the files in the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On mac python can be a little weird and you will have to do this:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome and encouraged. When making one however, please make sure to outline what you've done and USE COMMENTS. Please, please, please comment your code. I cannot read your mind and when I go over your code I want to be able to understand what the code does and how it works without having to step through every single line to see what it does. And if you don't know what something does in your code, try to figure it out or comment it. There are bits like that in mine, I won't be too harsh.
